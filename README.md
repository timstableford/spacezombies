A 2D space based game me (Tim Stableford) and Alex Badyda have been working on.
Excuse the poor commits, this was a private project.

The idea of the game will be eventually to have space battles, landing on planets and for it to be multiplayer.
As it stands, while writing this, the game only contains a simple solar system, a HUD experiment, and a spaceship.
